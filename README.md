The usw for observing campaigns

In the scheme of things Wayne uses ~/Observations as the main place to put all data and related things. Under that directory is a 'usw' directory, German for und so weiter -- and so forth. It in his astronomy analog to 'etc' -- a dir name that is way overloaded in both windows and unix.

Under this directory, is the 'targets' directory -- with a subdir for every target. Into each target directory are all the .csv, jpegs for pointing, 'hints' with envionment variables for the platesolve technique with sextractor.

This is strictly to manage/coordinate catalog and operational data for observing of targets.
